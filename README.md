## Notes

- If you are having trouble retrieving character data, use **"Reset and Stop"** in the plugin screen. This will change the character password and token information again. In this case, **you don't need** to match your character again.
- If your character **does not send data to the server for 5 minutes**; There will be "No connection" information in the mobile application. In this case, you may not see the character information in the mobile application.
